------------PONG the journey-----------------

This is an extension of the game idea of PONG.
It is a level-based adventure which is based 
on the love.physics extension of LÃ¶VE as a 
bindig to Box2D and was written in the 
programming language Lua.

In contrast to PONG it is a vertically aligned
single player adventure while the physics 
allow for more complex gameplay.
To be more specific here is a list of the most 
important implemented Features:

   - Main Menu with name & color choice

   - 10 stages in rising difficulty 
     and variable coloring

   - Choice of an Upgrade after each stage
     Upgrades are e.g.
	   - Gain player size
	   - Speed boost
	   - Telekinetic powers
	           .
                   .
		  etc.
		   .

   - CPU opponents are e.g.
  	   - CPU with a wall to destroy
	   - Tripple Paddle CPU
	   - Fast triangle shaped CPU
		   .
                   .
		   .

   - Implemented score tables for 
     normal & hard mode
     (With the help of the "Simple Indicative 
      of Competitive sKill" (SICK) library from
      https://gist.github.com/Kyrremann/
