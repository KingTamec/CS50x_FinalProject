You are responsible for understanding Harvard's policies on academic integrity 
and how to use sources responsibly.

__The Harvard College Honor Code states__:
Members of the Harvard College community commit themselves to producing academic work of integrity
– that is, work that adheres to the scholarly and intellectual standards of accurate attribution
of sources, appropriate collection and use of data, and transparent acknowledgement of the contribution
of others to their ideas, discoveries, interpretations, and conclusions. Cheating on exams or
problem sets, plagiarizing or misrepresenting the ideas or language of someone else as one’s own, 
falsifying data, or any other instance of academic dishonesty violates the standards of our community,
as well as the standards of the wider world of learning and affairs.
More information about the Honor Code as well as resources for students may be found at

This repo is designed to showcase the work that I, Thomas Feuerstein, have done. 
It's not designed as a resource for current, future, or past students to reference for help in any way.
